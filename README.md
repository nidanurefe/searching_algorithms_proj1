# ITU Algorithm 1 - Project 1

## Project Overview:
This project aims to implement various algorithms for sorting and analyzing tweets based on favouriteCount, retweetCount and tweetID. The algorithms used include Binary Search, Threshold, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort. The goal of this project is to apply these algorithms to sort tweets and perform data analysis.

## Algorithms Implemented:

1. **Binary Search:**
   - The Binary Search algorithm is used for fast searching on sorted data. It works by repeatedly dividing the data in half, allowing for an efficient search with a time complexity of O(log n).

2. **Threshold:**
   - The Threshold algorithm filters data based on a specific threshold value. This helps to select tweets that meet certain criteria and reduces the amount of data to be processed.

3. **Bubble Sort:**
   - Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if necessary. While intuitive, it has a time complexity of O(n²), making it inefficient for large datasets.

4. **Insertion Sort:**
   - Insertion Sort builds a sorted sequence one element at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position. It is efficient for small datasets but also has a time complexity of O(n²).

5. **Merge Sort:**
   - Merge Sort is a "divide and conquer" algorithm that recursively divides the data into two halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together. It has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it highly efficient for large datasets.

## How the Project Works:
These algorithms are used to sort and analyze tweets based on different criteria. The sorting algorithms are employed to arrange tweets in a meaningful order, while the threshold function filters out tweets based on predefined conditions. This project demonstrates how algorithms learned in the Algorithm 1 course can be applied to real-world problems.
